#Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the necessary packages using pip. Here is how you can set up the environment:
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
After setting up the environment, you can use the provided scripts to train and test the model. Follow these steps:

Prepare the Data: Ensure your data is in the required format.
Train the Model: Run the train_model.py script to train the model.
Make Predictions: Use the predict.py script to make predictions on new data.

Example command to train the model:

python train_model.py --input data/train.csv
Example command to make predictions:

python predict.py --input data/test.csv --output predictions.csv

#Data
The dataset used for training the model is from Kaggle's House Prices dataset. You need to download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

#Model
The model is implemented using [specific algorithms, e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.]. The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

#Results
Include a summary of the results achieved with the model. For example:
MAE: 0.15
RMSE: 0.25

#Contributing
